.Sh NAME
.Nm tbl
.Nd format tables for nroff or troff
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl g | Fl T Ar name
.Op Fl me | Fl mm | Fl ms
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a preprocessor for formatting tables for
.Xr nroff
or
.Xr troff .
The input files are copied to the standard output,
except for lines between
.Li .TS
and
.Li .TE
command lines, which are assumed to describe tables
and reformatted.
Arbitrary whitespace can be inserted between the dot and the commands
.Li .TS
or
.Li .TE .
Macros with these names are ignored by tbl if
.Sq '
is used instead of
.Sq \&. .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl T Ar name"
.It Fl g
.Nm
normally uses line drawing commands with repeated
underline and box rule characters
(\el and \eL).
With the
.Fl g
option,
graphic drawing commands (\eD) are used instead.
(This should only be used when processing troff input.)
Option
.Fl g
overrides a previous
.Fl T Ar name .
.It Fl me | mm | ms
With these options the respective macro packages
are copied to the beginning of the output.
Details are given in the reference manual.
.It Fl T Ar name
Configure nroff input processing.
.Ar name
can be one of:
. Bl -tag -width ".Cm locale"
. It Cm locale
If
. Nm
is used to process nroff input in an UTF-8 locale and
. Fl Tlocale
is given lines are printed using Unicode box characters
instead of underline and box rule characters.
If the current locale does not support UTF-8 this Option
has the same effect as
. Fl Tlp .
Option
. Fl Tlocale
overrides a previous
. Fl g .
. It Cm lp
Use ASCII characters (\-, =, |, +)
instead of underline and box rule characters.
Overrides a previous
. Fl g .
. It Cm X
The
. Fl TX
option causes
. Nm
not to produce fractional line motions.
. El
.El
.Sh "EXTENSIONS TO THE AT&T TBL KEY LETTERS
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm x , X"
.It Cm x , X
Expand column to make table as wide as the current line length.
If there is more then one column with a x specifier these
columns are expanded by the same amount.
This feature had been a GNU tbl extension.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
As an example, letting \(rst represent a tab (which should
be typed as a genuine tab)
the input
.Bd -unfilled -literal -offset indent

If no arguments are given,
.Nm
reads the standard input,
so it may be used as a filter.
When it is used with
.Xr eqn
or
.Xr neqn
the
.Nm
command should be first, to minimize the volume
of data passed through
pipes.
