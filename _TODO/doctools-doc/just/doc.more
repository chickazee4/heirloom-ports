       _L_i_n_e‐_b_y‐_l_i_n_e _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t

        When determining line breaks, _t_r_o_f_f tra‐
       ditionally  uses  a simple method:  Words
       are accumulated from  input  as  long  as
       they  fit  on  the  current  output line.
       Once a  word  consumes  more  space  than
       available,  it  is hyphenated.  If a fea‐
       sible breakpoint results, it  is  chosen;
       otherwise  the  current  output line ends
       with the previous word.
        If the adjustment mode is ‘‘b’’  (adjust
       both  margins)  and  the  line is shorter
       than the desired line  length,  interword
       spaces  are  widened  to  make  the  line
       fit.  The line is then printed either  to
       intermediate output or to the current di‐
       version, if any.  Afterwards, the process
       starts again.
        This method works  reasonably  well  but
       has  two  shortcomings:  First, it is not
       possible to compress interword spaces  by
       the  slightest  amount even if the break‐
       point obtainable by widening is inaccept‐
       able.    Second,  if  a  line  that  fits
       perfectly is followed by a line with very
       loose spacing, it might be better to move
       the last word of the first  line  to  the
       next one; then both lines might have less
       than perfect spacing, but it might never‐
       theless  be more acceptable than one line
       with very wide spaces.
        Both problems  are  addressed  in  _H_e_i_r_‐
       _l_o_o_m   _t_r_o_f_f.    As  usual,  the  default
       behavior  has  not  changed,  though,  so































          identical output will be produced for ex‐
          isting documents unless they are modified
          accordingly.


          _S_h_r_i_n_k_i_n_g _i_n_t_e_r_w_o_r_d _s_p_a_c_e_s

           The ‘‘.minss’’ request allows  to  spec‐
          ify  a  minimum  interword  space.  It is
          only effective when adjusting  both  mar‐
          gins.   It  accepts  an argument with the
          same semantics as  the  ‘‘.ss’’  request,
          i.e.  a  numeric value that is multiplied
          by 12/36 of the standard interword space.
          The  space  size  configured with ‘‘.ss’’
          is taken as the  optimum  setting.   Thus
          with the default ‘‘.ss 12’’, ‘‘.minss 9’’
          specifies that spaces may be shrunk to 75
          percent.
           The  line  breaking  process   is   then
          changed  such  that  when  the first word
          does not fit on the current  output  line
          anymore,  _t_r_o_f_f  is allowed to shrink in‐
          terword spaces to  make  it  fit  instead
          of  deferring  the  word to the next line
          and expanding  the  interword  spaces  on
          the  current  one.   _t_r_o_f_f  has  a slight
          preference for shrinking built‐in, so  if
          shrinking  and  expanding are equally far
          away from the optimum, shrinking is  cho‐
          sen.  If a line can be set with the opti‐
          mum setting, no shrinking is performed.

           To address the problem of an unnecessar‐


          4




























       ily loose line, it is obviously necessary
       to look ahead to following text.  Actual‐
       ly the best solution may involve multiple
       lines:   the line with sufficiently tight
       spacing might occur several lines  before
       the  loose  one, and each line in between
       simply starts one word earlier  but  con‐
       tains the same number of words.
        For  this  reason,  _t_r_o_f_f  collects  the
       words of an entire paragraph and computes
       optimal breakpoints when it is ended with
       the next request causing a _b_r_e_a_k.  Break‐
       points  are  considered  optimal  if  all
       interword  spaces in the paragraph are as
       close to the optimum setting as possible.
        Once the optimal breakpoints  have  been
       computed, the resulting lines are output.
       At this  time,  _t_r_a_p_s  become  effective.
       When the entire paragraph has been print‐
       ed, execution continues with the  request
       that  initially  caused  the _b_r_e_a_k at the
       end of the paragraph.
        Paragraph‐at‐once adjustment is  enabled
       per  paragraph  with ‘‘.ad p’’; the forms
       ‘‘.ad pc’’,  ‘‘.ad pl’’,  and  ‘‘.ad pr’’
       are  also  supported and apply the method
       to centered, left‐adjusted, and right‐ad‐
       justed text, respectively.
        The request ‘‘.padj’’  globally  enables
       paragraph‐at‐once  adjustment  across all
       environments; it is especially useful  to
       change  existing  documents  to  use this
       mode.
        Paragraph‐at‐once adjustment is compati‐
       ble  with almost all existing _t_r_o_f_f code.


                                               5




























          Most importantly, it  works  in  combina‐
          tion  with  the  _t_b_l, _e_q_n, _r_e_f_e_r, and _p_i_c
          preprocessors as well with  the  standard
          ‘‘–mm’’,  ‘‘–ms’’,  ‘‘–me’’, and ‘‘–man’’
          macro sets.
           The ‘‘.in’’, ‘‘.ti’’,  and  ‘‘.ll’’  re‐
          quests   should   only  be  used  to  set
          indenting and line length for  an  entire
          paragraph.   If  they  are  used within a
          paragraph, breakpoints must be  recomput‐
          ed, and previous breakpoints are subopti‐
          mal.  Documents  that  use  such  methods
          e.g. for inline pictures should be adapt‐
          ed to achieve optimum results with  para‐
          graph‐at‐once adjustment.
           Since positions on the output  line  are
          not  computed  until the entire paragraph
          has been collected, the ‘‘.k’’ and ‘‘.x’’
          number  registers cannot contain meaning‐
          ful values in  paragraph‐at‐once  adjust‐
          ment  mode.  Macros that test ‘‘.k’’ only
          to determine if  there  is  text  present
          will  work,  though,  since it is ensured
          that ‘‘.k’’ is never zero in this case.
           The number of the current  page  in  the
          ‘‘%’’ register can be lower than the num‐
          ber of the  page  on  which  the  current
          input  word  will  actually be printed in
          paragraph‐at‐once adjustment mode.   Thus
          e.g. to prepare words for indexing, it is
          not possible to associate them with  page
          numbers  when the input is read.  _O_u_t_p_u_t‐
          _l_i_n_e _t_r_a_p_s have been  introduced  to  ad‐
          dress  this issue:  A ‘‘\P[xx]’’ in input

          version processing along with the word it
          has been attached to.  When the line con‐
          taining it has been actually printed, the
          macro  ‘‘xx’’  is executed.  The behavior
          is then similar to a page trap.  Multiple
          output‐line  traps  may occur on a single
          line.
           An index macro can  use  this  mechanism
          to  defer the processing of an index term
          until after the position of the  word  it
          refers to has been determined:

            .nr IXcount 0 1
            .de IX
            .       de IX‐\\n+[IXcount]
            .       write index \\\\n% \\$1
            \\..
            \\P[IX‐\\n[IXcount]]\c
            ..
            An
            .IX "index term"
            index term is contained in this sample text.

          This example macro takes the  index  term
          as  a  single  argument.   It  creates  a
          separate macro  on  each  invocation  and
          prepends  an  output‐line trap calling it
          to  the  following  word.   The   created
          macro then prints the current page number
          (processed in this macro,  thus  preceded
          by  four  backslashes) and the index term
          argument (processed  in  the  surrounding
          macro, thus preceded by two backslashes).

       To further enlarge  the  range  available
       for  adjustment while reducing the amount
       by which interword spaces  are  affected,
       _t_r_o_f_f also allows to vary the size of in‐
       terletter spaces and the shape of  glyphs
       with  the ‘‘.letadj’’ request.  This pro‐
       cess is called ‘‘microtypography’’.
        Microtypography  must  be  applied  with
       care.   While  the  eye  is accustomed to
       varying interword spaces which leave  the
       individual  words  intact, varying inter‐
       letter spaces and letter  shapes  distort
       the  typeface as soon as they become not‐
       icable.  This  is  best  demonstrated  by
       using  them  as  an  exclusive adjustment
       mechanism:

          In combination with adjustment of  inter‐
          word  spaces,  and if applied with rather
          strict limits, microtypography  can  have
          positive  effects, though.  This is espe‐
          cially true when  lines  are  short;  the
          sample  text used so far can be formatted
          acceptably only if shrinking of interword
          spaces, paragraph‐at‐once adjustment, and
          microtypography are all combined:

       For layouts with  longer  lines  than  in
       this  example,  best results are normally
       achieved with  even  smaller  ranges  for
       letter spacing and glyph reshaping.

           It is possible to tell _t_r_o_f_f that a line
          break  after a certain word (or hyphenat‐
          ed word part) is preferred or discouraged
          by writing ‘‘\j’_N’’’.  A positive _N makes
          a breakpoint less likely,  a  negative  _N
          makes it more likely.
           By default, _t_r_o_f_f hyphenates words when‐
          ever  necessary in paragraph‐at‐once mode
          to minimize the  adjustment.   To  reduce
          the  number  of hyphenations, _h_y_p_h_e_n_a_t_i_o_n
          _p_e_n_a_l_t_i_e_s  can   be   configured.    Then
          whenever  a breakpoint involves a hyphen‐
          ation, it is  treated  as  less  optimal,
          and  another breakpoint that does not re‐
          quire a hyphenated word may be  preferred
          even  though  more  adjustment may become
          necessary.
           Additional penalties can  be  configured
          for  breakpoints that involve two succes‐
          sive hyphens,  and  for  hyphenating  the
          last word of a paragraph.
           The ‘‘.hypp’’ request takes  the  single
          hyphen penalty as its first argument, the
          penalty for consecutive hyphens  as  sec‐
          ond,  and the penalty for hyphenating the
          last word as third.  Effective  penalties
          are between 10 and 200.
           Hyphenation penalties only make  hyphens
          less   likely   but  do  not  limit  them
          forcibly.  The ‘‘.hlm’’  request  imposes
          a  strict limit on the number of consecu‐
          tive hyphens.  It causes a certain break‐
          point  to  be disabled completely and can


          12




























       thus result in a non‐optimal  adjustment.
       It  is  recommended to use it in combina‐
       tion with ‘‘.spreadwarn’’ to detect  such
       problems.

        The standard requests for setting indent
       and  line  length  cannot  be used inside
       a paragraph in paragraph‐at‐once  adjust‐
       ment  mode.  It is possible to define the
       shape of an entire paragraph line‐by‐line
       with  the  ‘‘.pshape’’ request.  It takes
       a list of indent and  line  length  pairs
       as  arguments;  the first pair applies to
       the first line of the paragraph, the sec‐
       ond  pair  to  the  second  line,  and so
       forth.  If the paragraph has  more  lines
       than  pairs  are  given, the last pair is
       used for them; it it has less lines,  the
       excess  pairs are discarded.  A paragraph
       shape is applied to  a  single  paragraph
       only;  it  overrides the standard indent,
       temporary indent, and  line  length  set‐
       tings,  of  which  indent and line length
       become effective for the  next  paragraph
       again.

                        For  example,
                     it   is   possible
                   to create  a  paragraph
                  whose  shape forms a cir‐
                 cle.   To  create  a   holey
                shape  like  this,  define an
               indent  and   line   pair   for
               each  contiguous  part  and use
              traps to  move     the  resulting
              lines in  ver‐     tical   direc‐
              tion   to   the    desired  posi‐
               tion.  This  is  best  done  in
               a  diversion  so that the whole
               structure  is   kept   togeth‐
                er;  diversion  traps are the
                 mechanism of  choice  then.

                     a circle with a hole

       _N_o_t_e_s

        For paragraph‐at‐once adjustment,  _t_r_o_f_f
       uses  a  variation of the algorithm orig‐
       inally  developed  by  Donald  Knuth  and
       Michael Plass for the _T_E_X system².
        The criteria for the quality of  a  line
       differ:   There  is no explicit stretcha‐
       bility setting, and the total shrinkabil‐
       ity is used to determine whether a break‐
       point is feasible, but not for  computing
       its  optimality.   _t_r_o_f_f  currently has a
       slight preference for  tight  lines.   It
       might  make  sense  to  have this config‐
       urable, but it seems that the  fact  that
       a  line may be stretched or shrinked by a
       high amount does not necessarily indicate
       the optimality of doing so.
        _t_r_o_f_f does not generate ‘‘overfull  box‐
       es’’,  i.e.  unadjustable  text extending
       beyond the margin, unless  the  width  of
       a  single  word exceeds that of the line.
       Its warning mechanism  can  inform  about
       unacceptable adjustments.
        _t_r_o_f_f makes no use  of  _f_i_t_n_e_s_s  _c_l_a_s_s_e_s
       and  does  not  prefer  to group lines of


                                              17




























          similar non‐optimal spacing.  This is be‐
          cause  doing  so  may lead to a more even
          appearance of the lines of  a  paragraph,
          but  at  the  expense  of a less even ap‐
          pearance in  the  context  of  the  whole
          document.  For example, consider the case
          of multiple consecutive lines with  loose
          spacing:   If  these  lines  are viewn in
          isolation, their spacing  looks  harmoni‐
          cally.   If  they  are viewn as part of a
          document, they look more bright than  the
          rest.   It is not clear how to solve this
          without optimizing the  spacing  globally
          for  a document, which is not a realistic
          option.
           Breakpoints that might occur at  differ‐
          ent  lines  are  currently  not evaluated
          separately for each  such  line.   Future
          evaluation  may indicate that doing so is
          necessary in practice.
           _t_r_o_f_f   implements   ‘‘microtypography’’
          similarly  as  described by Hàn Thế Thành
          for _T_E_X³.  In particular, it  performs  a
          function  like ‘‘level 2 font expansion’’
          (p. 70), i.e. it considers the possibili‐
          ty to shrink interletter spaces and char‐
          acter shapes when computing  breakpoints.
          Both stretchability and shrinkability are
          taken into account for computing the  op‐
          timality of a breakpoint, but only as far
          as the width of the possible line is con‐
          cerned;  the percentual adjustment limits
          do not influence optimality.
