README for the Heirloom Troff Justification Documentation
=========================================================

To build this manual, you need the Adobe Garamond Pro fonts,
and need to set the TROFFONTS variable accordingly. Adobe
Garamond Pro is available as part of the "Adobe Type Basics
OpenType Edition" package.

Note that as of autumn 2005, it was not possible to
download fonts bought directly from Adobe using a Linux
system. There are many other shops that sell Adobe fonts,
though, and these usually allow downloads for Linux users.

Update for the revised Heirloom Troff edition
=============================================

2014/09/05
The files contained in this directory have been modified to
use the Linux Libertine fonts if the fonts choosen by Gunnar
Ritter are not present in your system. The Linux Libertine
can be downloaded from <http://linuxlibertine.org>. You
still need to set the TROFFONTS variable accordingly.
