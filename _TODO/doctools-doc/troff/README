README for the Heirloom Documentation Tools Reference Manual
============================================================

To build the reference manual, you need to download the
OpenType variants of TeX Gyre Termes fonts available for
free from
<http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/termes>,
and to set the TROFFONTS variable such that it includes them.
