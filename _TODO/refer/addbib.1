.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p Ar promptfile
.Op Fl a
.Ar database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When this program starts up, answering
.Sq y
to the initial
.Dq Instructions?
prompt yields directions; typing
.Sq n
or
.Cm RETURN
skips them.
.Nm
then prompts for various bibliographic fields, reads responses from the
terminal, and sends output records to a
.Ar database .
A null response
.Aq just Cm RETURN
means to leave out that field.  A minus sign
.Aq -
means to go back to the previous field. A trailing backslash allows a field to
be continued on the next line. The repeating
.Dq Continue?
prompt allows the user either to resume by typing
.Sq y
or
.Cm RETURN ,
to quit the current session by typing
.Sq n
or
.Sq q ,
or to edit the
.Ar database
with any system editor
.Aq Cm vi , Cm ex , Cm edit , Cm ed ,
.Pp
The
.Fl a
option suppresses prompting for an abstract; asking for an abstract is the
default.  Abstracts are ended with a
.Cm CTRL-d .
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to use a new prompting skeleton, defined in
.Ar promptfile .
This file should contain prompt strings, a tab, and the key-letters to be
written to the
.Ar database .
.Pp
The most common key-letters and their meanings are given below.
.Nm
insulates you from these key-letters, since it gives you prompts in English,
but if you edit the bibliography file later on, you will need to know this
information.
