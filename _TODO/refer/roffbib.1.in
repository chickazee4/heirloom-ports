.Nd run off bibliographic database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ehnorsxVQ
.Op Fl T Ns Ar term
.Op Fl m Ns Ar mac
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints out all records in a bibliographic database,
in bibliography format rather than as footnotes or endnotes.
Generally it is used in conjunction with
.Cm sortbib :
.Bd -literal
sortbib  database | roffbib
.Ed
.Nm
accepts most of the options understood by
.Xr nroff 1 ,
most importantly the
.Fl T
flag to specify terminal type.
.Pp
If abstracts or comments are entered following the %X field key,
.Nm
will format them into paragraphs for an annotated bibliography.
Several %X fields may be given if several
annotation paragraphs are desired.
The
.Fl x
flag will suppress the printing of these abstracts.
.Pp
A user-defined set of macros
may be specified after the
.Fl m
option.
There should be a space between the
.Fl m
and the macro filename.
This set of macros will replace the ones
defined in
.Pa /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/bib .
The
.Fl V
flag will send output to the Versatec; the
.Fl Q
flag will queue output for the phototypesetter.
.Pp
Four command-line registers control formatting style
of the bibliography, much like the number registers of
.Xr ms 7 .
The command-line argument
.Fl r Ns Ar N1
will number
the references starting at one (1).
The flag
.Fl r Ns Ar V2
will double space the biblio\%graphy,
while
.Fl r Ns Ar V1
will double space references
but single space annotation paragraphs.
The line length can be changed from the default 6.5 inches
to 6 inches with the
.Fl r Ns Ar L6i
argument,
and the page offset can be set from the default of 0
to one inch by specifying
.Fl r Ns Ar O1i
(capital O, not zero).
Note: with the
.Fl V
and
.Fl Q
flags
the default page offset is already one inch.

to create customized formats.
