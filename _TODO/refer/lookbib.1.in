.Sh NAME
.Nm indxbib ,
.Nm lookbib
.Nd build inverted index for a bibliography, find references in a bibliography
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar database ...
.Nm lookbib
.Ar database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes an inverted index to the named
.Ar databases
(or files) for use by
.Xr lookbib 1
and
.Xr refer 1 .
These files contain bibliographic references
(or other kinds of information) separated by blank lines.
.Pp
A bibliographic reference is a set of lines,
constituting fields of bibliographic information.
Each field starts on a line beginning with a ``%'',
followed by a key-letter, then a blank,
and finally the contents of the field,
which may continue until the next line starting with ``%''.
.Pp
.Nm
is a shell script that calls
.Pa /usr/ucblib/reftools/mkey
and
.Pa /usr/ucblib/reftools/inv.
The first program,
.Cm mkey ,
truncates words to 6 characters,
and maps upper case to lower case.
It also discards words shorter than 3 characters,
words among the 100 most common English words,
and numbers (dates) < 1900 or > 2000.
These parameters can be changed; see page 4 of the
.Cm Refer
document by Mike Lesk.
The second program,
.Cm inv,
creates an entry file (.ia),
a posting file (.ib), and a tag file (.ic),
all in the working directory.
.Pp
.Nm lookbib
uses an inverted index made by
.Nm
to find sets of bibliographic references.
It reads keywords typed after the ``>'' prompt on the terminal,
and retrieves records containing all these keywords.
If nothing matches, nothing is returned except another ``>'' prompt.
.Pp
.Nm lookbib
will ask if you need instructions, and will print some brief information if
you reply ``y''.
.Pp
It is possible to search multiple databases,
as long as they have a common index made by
.Nm .
In that case, only the first argument given to
.Nm
is specified to
.Nm lookbib .
.Pp
If
.Nm lookbib
does not find the index files (the .i[abc] files),
it looks for a reference file with the same name as the argument,
without the suffixes.
It creates a file with a `.ig' suffix, suitable for use with
.Cm fgrep .
It then uses this fgrep file to find references.
This method is simpler to use, but the .ig file is slower to use
than the .i[abc] files, and does not allow the use of multiple reference files.
.Sh FILES
.Pa x Ns .ia,
.Pa x Ns .ib,
.Pa x Ns .ic,
where
.Em x
is the first argument, or if these are not present, then
.Pa x Ns .ig,
.Pa x

.Sh NOTES
Probably all dates should be indexed,
since many disciplines refer to literature
written in the 1800s or earlier.
