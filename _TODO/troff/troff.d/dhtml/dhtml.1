.Dt DHTML 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhtml
.Nd HTML postprocessor for troff
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl t Ar title
.Li < Ar ditroff_output Li > Ar html_output
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a HTML postprocessor for
.Xr troff 1 .
It reads the ditroff output from
.Dv STDIN
and writes HTML5 output to
.Dv STDOUT .
.Nm troff
must in this case be called with option
.Fl Thtml .
Missing charaters can be added by changing the files
.Pa charset
and
.Pa CHAR
(see section
.Sx FILES ) .
For adding fonts the tool needs to be recompiled (currently the
legacy fonts
.Li R I B BI C CW CR CI CB H HI HB S
are available).
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl t Ar title"
.It Fl t Ar title
Set text for the HTML
.Li <title>
tag.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag
.It Ar source_dir Ns Pa /troff/troff.d/font/devhtml/charset
.Sy charset
which is appended to each font description file at installation
of the tool (run
.Pp
.Dl # make install
.Pp
after changes of this file).
.It Pa $FNTDIR/devhtml/CHAR
Character to HTML name mapping which is read at each run of
.Nm .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Li tbl Ar manpage Li | troff -Thtml -mandoc \(rs
.Li "    |" dhtml Li -t Ar html_title Li > Ar html_file
.Ed
.Pp
Convert
.Ar manpage
into HTML format with title
.Ar html_title
and save it as
.Ar html_file .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr troff 1 ,
.Xr dpost 1
.Sh BUGS
For the current version no changes to the ditroff interface are done.
All information for formatting the HTML page is taken from legacy ditroff
commands.
As a consequence the alignment cannot be as accurate as in the
.Xr dpost 1
output since the character widths of HTML fonts must be supposed to be
unknown.
.Pp
At the moment no HTML tables are generated.
.Xr tbl 1
(without options) can be used for preprocessing but mayor alingment issues
may result.
There is no support for equations, graphics, images, and links in this
versions.
These features are subject to be implemented later.
